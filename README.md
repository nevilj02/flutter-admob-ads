## Android Specific Setup
### Update your AndroidManifest.xml

Add your AdMob App ID to your app's AndroidManifest.xml file by adding the `<meta-data>` tag shown below. You can find your App ID in the AdMob UI. For android:value insert your own AdMob App ID in quotes, as shown below.

You can use these test App ID's from Admob for development:
```
Android: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713 
```

```xml
<manifest>
  <application>
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
      android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713"/>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

### Initialize the plugin

First thing to do before attempting to show any ads is to initialize the plugin. You can do this in the earliest starting point of your app, your `main` function:

```dart

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  
  GAService.askConsent(
    isDebug: true,
    debugGeography: DebugLocation.debugGeographyEea,
    testIds: ['8632117E8B093EC69374D08607E50253'],
    onConsentUpdate: () => GAService.init(
        videoNativeAdId: 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1044960115'),
    onError: (error) {
      print('error -> $error');
      GAService.init(
          videoNativeAdId: 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1044960115');
    },
  );
}
```
